# Unsupervised-Learning
The importance of unsupervised Learning is often overlooked. It's practicality doesn't only expand to fields of medicine with image segmentation (very prominent in cancer detection) or data engineering (data imputation through learning of patterns) but could also (with help of dimensionality reduction schemes) provide a tool for visualization

This repo offers implementation and explanations on some of the existing unsupervised models (mixture models, clustering algorithms etc.) and their implementations on real world dataset.

Note that every project is still an open research and even though being vastly used and immensely useful offer possibilities for improvement
